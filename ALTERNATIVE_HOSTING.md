# 🚀 Alternative Hosting Solutions

Railway is having issues. Here are better alternatives for your trading bot:

## 🏆 RECOMMENDED: Render.com

### Why Render is Better:
✅ More reliable health checks
✅ Better free tier (750 hours/month)
✅ Less strict timeout policies
✅ Easier deployment process

### Deploy to Render:
1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
2. **Connect GitHub**: Link `suhailk-k/tradingbot1`
3. **Service Type**: Web Service
4. **Build Command**: `pip install flask` (or leave empty)
5. **Start Command**: `python run_minimal.py`
6. **Environment Variables**:
   ```
   PORT=10000
   PYTHON_UNBUFFERED=1
   ```

## 🔥 Alternative 1: Fly.io (Best for 24/7)

### Benefits:
✅ True 24/7 operation (no sleep)
✅ 3 shared-cpu VMs free
✅ Global deployment
✅ Better for trading bots

### Deploy to Fly.io:
```bash
# Install flyctl
curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh

# Deploy
flyctl apps create your-trading-bot
flyctl deploy
```

Or use their web interface with your GitHub repo.

## 🌟 Alternative 2: Heroku

### Setup:
1. Connect GitHub repo: `suhailk-k/tradingbot1`
2. **Buildpack**: Python
3. **Procfile**: Already exists (`web: python run_minimal.py`)
4. **Config Vars**: 
   ```
   PORT: (automatic)
   PYTHON_UNBUFFERED: 1
   ```

## 💎 Alternative 3: Vercel (Serverless)

### For simple web interface:
1. Import from GitHub
2. **Framework**: Other
3. **Build Command**: (empty)
4. **Output Directory**: (empty)
5. **Install Command**: `pip install flask`

## 🔧 Local Testing First

Before deploying anywhere, test locally:

```bash
# Test the minimal server
python run_minimal.py

# In another terminal
curl http://localhost:8000

# Should return:
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "BTC Trading Bot",
  "mode": "paper_trading",
  "balance": "$20.00"
}
```

## 🎯 Railway Alternative Configuration

If you want to try Railway one more time:

### Option 1: Worker Service (No Health Check)
```toml
[build]
builder = "nixpacks"

[deploy]
startCommand = "python run_console.py"
restartPolicyType = "always"

[environments.production.variables]
PYTHON_UNBUFFERED = "1"
```

### Option 2: Web Service with Longer Timeout
```toml
[build]
builder = "nixpacks"

[deploy]
startCommand = "python run_minimal.py"
healthcheckPath = "/"
healthcheckTimeout = 300
restartPolicyType = "always"
```

## 📊 Comparison Table

| Service | Uptime | Health Checks | Free Tier | Best For |
|---------|--------|---------------|-----------|----------|
| **Render** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Flexible | 750h/month | Web services |
| **Fly.io** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Reliable | 3 VMs | 24/7 bots |
| **Heroku** | ⭐⭐⭐ | Good | 550h/month | Simple apps |
| **Railway** | ⭐⭐ | Strict | 500h/month | Simple services |

### Heroku:

## 💡 My Recommendation

1. **Try Render.com first** - Most reliable for trading bots
2. **Fly.io second** - Best for true 24/7 operation
3. **Heroku third** - Easiest setup but limited hours

All three are more reliable than Railway for trading applications!

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. **Choose a platform** from above
2. **Test locally first** with `python run_minimal.py`
3. **Deploy using the specific instructions**
4. **Monitor logs** for any issues
5. **Add trading features** gradually once basic deployment works
