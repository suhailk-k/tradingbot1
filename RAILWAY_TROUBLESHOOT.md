# ðŸš¨ Railway Deployment Troubleshooting

## Current Issue: Health Check Failures

Railway keeps failing health checks. Here are multiple solutions:

## ðŸ”§ Solution 1: Ultra-Minimal Deployment (RECOMMENDED)

### Files to use:
- **Start Command**: `python run_minimal.py`
- **Requirements**: None (uses Python standard library only)
- **Health Check**: `http://your-app.railway.app/`

### Railway Settings:
```
Build Command: (leave empty)
Start Command: python run_minimal.py
Environment Variables:
  PORT=8000
  PYTHON_UNBUFFERED=1
```

## ðŸ”§ Solution 2: Zero Dependencies

### Use the socket-based server:
- **Start Command**: `python run_zero_deps.py`
- **Zero external dependencies**
- **Pure Python standard library**

## ðŸ”§ Solution 3: Alternative Hosting

### If Railway continues to fail, try:

#### Render.com:
```
Repository: https://github.com/suhailk-k/tradingbot1
Build Command: (empty)
Start Command: python run_minimal.py
Environment: PORT=10000
```

#### Heroku:
```
Create Procfile: web: python run_minimal.py
Add buildpack: python
Set config vars: PORT (automatic)
```

#### Fly.io:
```
fly launch --generate-name
fly deploy
```

## ðŸ”§ Solution 4: Railway Configuration

### In Railway Dashboard:
1. **Delete current deployment**
2. **Create new service from GitHub**
3. **Settings â†’ Environment**:
   ```
   PORT=8000
   PYTHON_UNBUFFERED=1
   ```
4. **Settings â†’ Deploy**:
   ```
   Start Command: python run_minimal.py
   ```

### Custom railway.toml:
```toml
[build]
builder = "nixpacks"

[deploy]
startCommand = "python run_minimal.py"
healthcheckPath = "/"
healthcheckTimeout = 60

[environments.production.variables]
PYTHON_UNBUFFERED = "1"
PORT = "8000"
```

## ðŸ”§ Solution 5: Local Testing

### Test before deploying:
```bash
# Test minimal server
python run_minimal.py

# In another terminal
curl http://localhost:8000

# Expected response:
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "BTC Trading Bot",
  "mode": "paper_trading",
  "balance": "$20.00"
}
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Should Work

1. **No dependencies** - Can't fail due to package installation
2. **Standard HTTP server** - Uses Python's built-in http.server
3. **Immediate response** - No complex initialization
4. **Proper port binding** - Uses Railway's PORT environment variable
5. **Health check ready** - Responds to `/` endpoint immediately

## ðŸ“Š Expected Success Response

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "BTC Trading Bot",
  "mode": "paper_trading", 
  "balance": "$20.00",
  "deployment": "Railway.app",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-22T00:57:20.881653",
  "message": "âœ… Trading bot deployed successfully!"
}
```

## ðŸ”„ If Still Failing

### Check Railway logs for:
- Port binding errors
- Python version issues
- Process startup problems

### Alternative: Manual deployment
1. Download repo as ZIP
2. Create new Railway project
3. Upload files manually
4. Set start command: `python run_minimal.py`

## ðŸ’¡ Next Steps After Success

1. âœ… Verify deployment works
2. ðŸ”„ Add gradual complexity
3. ðŸ“Š Monitor performance
4. ðŸš€ Scale as needed

**The minimal approach eliminates all possible failure points!**
