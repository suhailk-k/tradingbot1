# 🚂 Railway App Configuration Guide

## ✅ Optimized Railway Configuration

Your trading bot is now configured specifically for Railway.app deployment with these optimizations:

### 🔧 Key Railway Configurations

#### **Service Type: Worker Service**
- **No web server** (eliminates health check issues)
- **No port binding** (avoids Railway port conflicts)
- **Pure background worker** (perfect for trading bots)
- **Auto-restart enabled** (Railway restarts on failures)

#### **Safety Features for Railway**
- **Paper trading ENFORCED** (no real money risk)
- **Testnet only** (safe testing environment)
- **Reduced position sizes** ($3 vs $5)
- **Limited trades** (2/day vs 3/day)
- **Conservative settings** (optimized for free tier)

### 🚀 Railway Deployment Steps

#### **1. Service Configuration**
In Railway dashboard:
```
Service Type: Choose "Empty Service" (not Web Service)
GitHub Repo: suhailk-k/tradingbot1
Deploy Branch: main
```

#### **2. Build Settings**
```
Build Command: pip install -r requirements-railway.txt
Start Command: python run_railway_worker.py
```

#### **3. Environment Variables**
Add these in Railway dashboard:
```env
BINANCE_API_KEY=NZUpgDwJwCfenPbvdhxNGPzfmLaNxAchUnED9aqvZ4d9CIiseSOepBdAjnbBwu4g
BINANCE_SECRET_KEY=pZIeIcmV85l8CzEWf14Vhq0AL7ZVi4grcaDsixRVogO2ZIUXAIzWQpMs155Y0Lc6
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyAkaQaYLzx5dkxny3424qH_wZ1BmFhsBEY
RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT=production
PYTHON_UNBUFFERED=1
BINANCE_TESTNET=True
```

#### **4. Railway-Specific Files**
✅ `railway.toml` - Worker service configuration
✅ `run_railway_worker.py` - Railway-optimized bot runner
✅ `requirements-railway.txt` - Minimal dependencies
✅ `config_railway.py` - Railway safety configurations
✅ `Procfile` - Worker process definition

### 📊 Expected Railway Logs

After deployment, you'll see:
```
🚂 Railway Trading Bot Worker
==================================================
📡 Environment: Railway.app
📊 Mode: Paper Trading
💰 Virtual Balance: $20.00
🎯 Position Size: $3.00
🛡️ Risk Management: 5% per trade
⚡ Max Trades/Day: 2

🚀 Initializing full trading bot...
```

### 🎯 Why This Configuration Works

#### **No Health Check Issues**
- Worker service = no web server = no health checks
- Eliminates Railway's strict health check timeouts
- Background process runs continuously

#### **Optimized for Railway Free Tier**
- Minimal dependencies (faster builds)
- Conservative resource usage
- Auto-restart on failures
- Reduced API calls

#### **Safety First**
- Paper trading only (no real money)
- Testnet environment (safe testing)
- Smaller positions ($3 vs $5)
- Limited daily trades (2 vs 3)

### 🔄 Alternative: Worker + Web Service

If you want monitoring, deploy both:

#### **Service 1: Worker (Trading Bot)**
```
Start Command: python run_railway_worker.py
Environment: (API keys as above)
```

#### **Service 2: Web (Status Page)**
```
Start Command: python run_minimal.py
Environment: PORT=8000
```

### 📈 Monitoring Your Railway Bot

#### **View Logs**
Railway Dashboard → Your Service → Logs tab

#### **Check Status**
Look for these log patterns:
```
💓 Heartbeat #X - Railway worker active
📊 Trading Bot Status Report:
✅ Bot initialized successfully
[timestamp] Trade analysis: BTC/USDT
```

#### **Performance Metrics**
Railway shows:
- CPU usage
- Memory consumption
- Network traffic
- Restart count

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting

#### **If Deployment Fails**
1. Check Railway logs for errors
2. Verify environment variables
3. Ensure GitHub repo is connected
4. Try redeploying from Railway dashboard

#### **If Bot Stops**
Railway auto-restarts failed services:
- Check logs for error messages
- Verify API keys are correct
- Ensure sufficient Railway credits

#### **Common Issues**
- **Build failures**: Check requirements-railway.txt
- **Import errors**: Verify all dependencies installed
- **API errors**: Check Binance/Gemini API keys
- **Memory issues**: Railway free tier has memory limits

### 🎯 Success Indicators

✅ **Service shows "Running"** in Railway dashboard
✅ **Logs show heartbeat messages** every minute
✅ **No restart loops** (stable operation)
✅ **Trading analysis logs** appear periodically
✅ **No error messages** in logs

### 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Monitor Railway credits** - free tier has limits
2. **Check logs regularly** - for trade opportunities
3. **Upgrade when ready** - for production trading
4. **Test locally first** - before each deployment
5. **Keep backups** - of successful configurations
